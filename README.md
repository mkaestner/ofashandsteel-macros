# ofashandsteel-macros
For:

Of Ash and Steel v1.04

I use these macros to bypass the lockpicking minigame. Note that I am playing on hardest difficulty, so they might work for other difficulties! In my game, these hit with a 100% success chance, even with minimum dexterity (10) and without the lockpicking perk. Tested in the city of Grayshaft.

Usage:

1. Download and install https://www.mouseclickmacro.com/
2. Load one of the files depending on usage
  * EASY
    * for most doors
    * results in some bumps, it's fine though
  * MEDIUM
    * for some doors
    * for some chests (mostly citizens)
    * shouldn't result in more than 2-3 bumps
  * HARD
    * for a lot of chests (mostly shop owners and special places)
    * shouldn't result in more than 2-3 bumps
3. Define key at the bottom of the window (standard is 'p')
4. Hit key and watch it resolve beautifully
